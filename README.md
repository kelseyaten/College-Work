Projects throughout my years at UNH

P1 is a project completed in my Operating Systems Class. It is a java file written using Android Studio. 
The app allows the user to search for an artist and it will display the top 10 songs and album covers of that artist.
The user can then click on the song and it will play a 30 second preview.
